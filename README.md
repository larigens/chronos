## Installation

If you would like to understand more about the code behind the app and edit it:

### Cloning the Repository

Click `<> code` - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows/Linux, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally. If you need more information on how to clone a repository, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)!

## Usage

This application allows you to easily and quickly organize your daily events by the hour they occur. Each line will be color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. To create an event on your daily planner, all you need to do is enter your plan for that hour and click the "Save" button to ensure that it will store the data.
